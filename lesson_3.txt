When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are working on a project that requires other people to view or edit your work, if you are working
on a group project, or if you simply want to have a back up of your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you make a change to your remote repository and you do not want to push it to the actual file, you would not want automatic updating.
