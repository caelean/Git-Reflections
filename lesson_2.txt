What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates a git repository inside the current directory.
This allows you to add and track files within the directory.
It does not create any commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as a place for files to stay that designates them as part of the next commit. This allows you to commit individual files and individual changes without saving everything at once.
